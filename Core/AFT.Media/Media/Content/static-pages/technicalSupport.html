    <p><strong>Unsupported Browsers</strong></p>
    <p>We no longer support IE8 browser when developing and testing new features. On a global level Microsoft will also stop the maintenance for IE8 after 2015 for many reasons. No loss of existing functionality is to be expected, however future cases might occur.</p>
    <p><strong>General Troubleshooting</strong></p>

    <p>All web browsers (including Safari on the iPhone) will store web pages, these are called cache and cookies. Your web browser stores these to help speed up internet usage. So if you revisit a web page the browser will attempt to load it from cache first which will be quicker than pulling the page again from the internet.</p>
    <p>Continued use of the browser can build up a large storage of cache and cookies which can slow down and cause errors when using the internet.<strong> </strong>Clearing the cache and cookies can help to speed up both your phone and browser speeds. It is typically recommended that users clear their cache and cookies once a week.</p>
