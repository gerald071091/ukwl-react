        <p>We recognise that for a minority of our customers gambling can become an addictive behaviour which can lead to a range of problems for individuals and their families. As a result of this we believe that we have a social responsibility to act positively in relation to problem gambling. We recognise that as a provider of gambling services we have a responsibility to be aware of the social consequences of gambling. We endeavour to implement as many measures as possible to protect people who are vulnerable to gambling whether they are underage or susceptible to gambling problems.</p>

        <p>Please contact Customer Services for any assistance or further information on how to manage your gambling.</p>
        <p>Email: <a href="mailto:{0}" class="maillink">{0}</a> or via 24/7 live chat</p>

        <h3 class="mainTitle">Under Age Gambling</h3>
        <p>We take responsibilities against under age gambling extremely seriously. It is illegal for anyone under the age of 18 to gamble and it is in strict contravention of our Terms and Conditions for anyone under the age of 18 to register on our site. We have verification systems in place which will aid us in preventing any such registration. No winnings will be paid to any person who is found to have abused this and we reserve the right to report any such person to the police.</p>
        <p>If satisfactory age verification has not been completed within 72 hours of registration for an account on our site, the below applies:-</p>
        <ul class="circle listStyle">
            <li>Your account will be frozen;</li>
            <li>no further gambling will be permitted until age verification has been successfully completed; and</li>
            <li>if on completion of age verification you are shown to be underage, all deposits held will be returned and any winnings will become void.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="mainTitle">Staff Training</h3>
        <p>Every member of staff who we consider to be "front line" is given training in Social Responsibility and Responsible Gambling awareness.</p>

    <div class="section-4">
        <h3 class="mainTitle">TIME-OUT AND SELF-EXCLUSION</h3>
        <p class="p-1">We provide Self-Exclusion and Time Out facilities to assist our customers with managing their gambling. Self-exclusion can be applied for periods at your discretion between six (6) months to five (5) years. If this option is taken it is understood that you may not access your account until the expiry of the self-exclusion period. If you request temporary self-exclusion we will apply this to your account within 2 days,  or if you apply self-exclusion using the automatic function within Your Account settings this will be applied immediately.  Your Account cannot be re-opened within the exclusion period. We will do everything we can to prevent a new account from an excluded customer being opened during the period of self-exclusion.</p>
        <p class="p-2">During self-exclusion you will not receive any promotional or marketing materials from us and you will have to contact us to re-open your account once the self-exclusion period has expired. After you have notified us of your wish to re-open a previously self-excluded account we will only do so after a 24 hour cooling off period.</p>
        <p class="p-3">When self-excluding any funds held on your account will be returned to you, however unsettled bets prior to event start time will remain valid and the stake will not be returned to your account. Any event in-play or started cannot be voided.</p>
        <p class="p-4">Time-outs can be applied for 24hours, one week, one month; or any other period as requested up to a maximum of six weeks. Once the Time-Out period has ended, Your Account will automatically re-open.</p>
        <p class="p-5">You may apply these limits yourself in the responsible gambling section of your account or by contacting Customer Services.</p>
        <p class="p-6">If you wish to permanently close your account due to problem gambling, please contact our Customer Services Team. If this action is taken, your account cannot be re-opened under any circumstances.</p>
        <p class="p-7">Should you wish for your IP address to be blocked from accessing our site during the Time-Out or Self-Exclusion period, please contact Customer Services.</p>
        <p class="p-8">Whilst we encourage you to consider applying the same limits to your other gambling accounts, self-exclusion instructions received by Us will only affect your use of  <a href="http://{1}" target="_blank">{1}</a>.</p>
        <p class="p-9">In addition to this website a number of other websites are operated under the licences of TGP Limited and TGP Europe Limited.  Any request you make for an Account Limit, Time-out or Self-exclusion to be set on your account will not automatically be applied to accounts that you may have with other gambling websites operated under the licence of TGP Limited or TGP Europe Limited.  We will provide details of all other gambling websites operated under these licences when you contact us to apply limits to one account.  We will only apply limits to these accounts when requested to do so by you.  Limits will be applied within 2 days of receipt of such a request.</p>
        <p class="p-9">If gambling is having a negative impact on your life, we recommend that you consider the implications of this before agreeing to our Terms & Conditions and using our services.</p>
        <p class="p-9">If you do not have the means to lose the money which you gamble, we recommend that you do not gamble on our website. @CMS.SiteName uses third party tools to identify customers and establish source of wealth information and in certain circumstances we will contact customers to ensure that they are comfortable with their level of  gambling.</p>
        <p class="p-10">If you wish to close your account for any other reason, please contact customer services for further assistance.</p>

        <h3 class="mainTitle">Deposit Limits</h3>
        <p class="p-1">You can control your betting by setting a maximum limit on your daily, weekly or monthly deposits. Please note that if you increase your deposit limit we are required by law to apply a 24 hour cooling-off period, before making the change. You may refer to your My Account > Settings page to access this option. To enable this facility please email our Customer Services Team at  <a href="mailto:{0}">{0}</a> </p>
        <p class="p-1">You can increase or decrease your deposit limit at any time in My Account > Settings or by contacting <a href="mailto:{0}">Customer Services</a>, however please note that you are in effect implementing a new limit facility, as a consequence when the new limit takes effect the full amount of your new limit will be available to you irrespective of previous deposits made.</p>
        <p class="p-2">Often people don't recognise the warning signs. Gambling doesn't usually start out as a problem â€“ for most people it begins as a fun and social activity. If gambling is no longer fun or if you've tried a few times to cut back and you're wondering what to do next then these tips might help:-</p>
        <ul class="circle listStyle">
            <li>Only spend what you can afford to lose. If necessary set yourself a budget or impose betting limits on your account.</li>
            <li>Only play when you can afford it without the need to borrow.</li>
            <li>Never chase your losses.</li>
            <li>Always keep track of what you have spent.</li>
            <li>Remember that you are playing with REAL MONEY.</li>
        </ul>
