    <p> <strong>23.2</strong> For  multiple bets including selections from markets where different limits apply,  the maximum payout on the bet will default to the lowest applicable limit and  in no case shall exceed €50,000 (or equivalent amount in other currencies).<strong></strong></p>
    <p> <strong>23.3</strong> As stated in Clause 13.4, the maximum winnings payable by us to any Player for any one calendar day (00:00 - 23:59) on any valid bet or combination of Bets, including Ante Post shall be limited to a maximum of fifty thousand pounds sterling (€50,000) in aggregate.</p>
    <p> <strong>23.4</strong> Any group  of Players who have placed the same combination of selections and we believe  have been acting as a syndicate, will be treated as one Player for the purpose  of the above limits.<strong></strong></p>
    <p> <strong>23.5</strong> The  maximum amount you can Bet varies according to the type of Gambling and the  terms offered by us in relation to the type of Gambling as detailed in these  Terms and Conditions relevant Rules and/or the Website and is subject to change  without prior notice but in any event will not exceed the funds in Your Account  available to place Bets.<strong></strong></p>
    <p> <strong>23.6</strong> Players are permitted to establish self-imposed deposit limits to restrict the nature of their transactions in the 'My Account' section of the Website or by contacting Customer Services.  Maximum thresholds limits can be placed by deposit value and by term; the terms are daily, weekly or monthly.  Once the deposit value limit threshold is reached further deposits will not be possible until the term period chosen has ended.  Players can amend and cancel such thresholds in the 'My Account' section of the Website or by contacting us via email (see contact us page) however if this is an increase in the deposit value this will only be implemented after a 24 hour cooling-off period has elapsed and a second confirmation has been accepted by you.  Any change to the deposit value limit or the term limit is in effect implementing a new limit facility, consequently when the new limit takes effect the full deposit value set will be available to you irrespective of previous deposits made.</p>
