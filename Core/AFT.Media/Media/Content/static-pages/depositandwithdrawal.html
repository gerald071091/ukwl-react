        <p>The fastest deposit method is by secure online  payment using a UK debit or credit card. </p>
        <p>You will be required to enter your CVV number (the  three digits on the reverse of your card) and you may be asked to complete a  3DSecure (3DS) questionnaire. 3DS helps prevent your card from being used  without your permission and will only take a few seconds.&nbsp; We recommend  that you use the ‘Greeting’ or ‘Notes’ Field on the 3DS screen to add a prompt  which will help you remember your password. </p><br>
        <p>Please note that your CVV number and 3DS will not  be stored in our system, as you are to be required to follow the same security  process every time you make a deposit.</p><br>
        <p>If you deposit using a Corporate Card, non-UK  registered Card or a MasterCard we may not be able to send your withdrawal  request back to the same card.&nbsp; Under these circumstances Customer  Services will make arrangements with you to send the payment by alternative  means. </p><br>
